# Authentication App

## Intro
This is a simple authentication app created primarily as a learning project to gain familiarity with React, JWT, and safe authentication practices. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes (Home and Profile)

## Features
- User authentication (signup and login)
- Access control for protected routes
- Basic user profile page

## Technologies used
- React
- axios (http client used for making requests to backend server)
- bcrypt (library for securely hashing and verifying passwords)
- jsonwebtoken (used to generate and verify JWT for user authentication)
- MongoDB

## Learning objectives
- Practice and acquire skills using React
- Understand the concept on JSON web tokens and how to implement secure authentication
- Learn to create reusable hooks for managing state in React
- Explore navigation in React apps
- Gain insights into cookie management for persisting login sessions
- Understand hashing algorithms on a deeper level

## Future improvements
- More robust error handling
- Add more user information (First name, last name, email, profile picture, bio, etc.)
- Password reset functionality, username change, verify email
- Deleting profile
